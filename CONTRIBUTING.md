# Contributing to Shrink It!

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Submitting an issue that is improperly or incompletely written is a waste of time for everybody.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.


## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs),
[features requests](#features) and [submitting pull
requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests
* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search**  
   Check if the issue has already been reported. Reporting duplicates is a waste of
   time for everyone. Search in **all issues**, open and closed.
2. **Check if the issue has been fixed**  
   Try to reproduce it using the latest `master` or development branch in the repository.
   Maybe it has been fixed since the last stable release.
3. **Give details**  
   A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
   information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.
   Give any information that is relevant to the bug: 
   * Shrink It and Node versions
   * Server Software
   * Browser name & version
   
   What is the expected output? What do you see instead? See the report example below.  
7. **Isolate the problem**  
   Isolate the problem as much as you can, reduce to the bare minimum required to reproduce the issue.
   Don't describe a general situation that doesn't work as expected and just count on us to pin
   point the problem.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the project developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.


<a name="pull-requests"></a>
## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

1. **Please ask first**  
   Before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features,
   refactoring code), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on
   something that the developers might not want to merge into the project.
2. **Licensing**  
   By submitting a patch, you agree that your code will be licensed under the
   [MIT License](https://github.com/HyperNovaVY/shrink-it/blob/master/LICENSE) terms.
3. **Coding Standards**  
   Please adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the project (indentation,
   comments, etc.). Make sure you've tested your patch under
   different scenarios (various browsers, non default installation path, etc.).

Adhering to the following this process is the best way to get your work
merged:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the repo, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <repo-name>
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<upsteam-owner>/<repo-name>
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout <dev-branch>
   git pull upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream <dev-branch>
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

10. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description.
