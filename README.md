# Shrink It - A simple url shortener

Welcome to my first project, this is a backend url shortener app made with NodeJS, Pug and MongoDB using MVC architecture.

**Shrink It !** is a **public** url shortener, it means everyone can see the links that have been shrinked so far, so please **don't post any sensitive information**

> **_Currently this project is deployed with Heroku, so it doesn't own an official domain._**
